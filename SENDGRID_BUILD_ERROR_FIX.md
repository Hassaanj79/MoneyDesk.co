# ✅ SendGrid Build Error - Fixed

## Problem

The build error occurred because:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve 'fs'
```

SendGrid's `@sendgrid/mail` package uses Node.js built-in modules (`fs`, `path`) which are not available in browser/client-side environments. When the email service was imported in client-side code, it caused build failures.

## Solution

### Architecture Change:

**Before (Broken):**
```typescript
// Client-side code trying to import SendGrid directly
import { sendEmail } from './services/email'; // ❌ Fails - tries to import SendGrid in browser
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
// Client-side code
import { sendEmail } from './services/email'; // ✅ Works - calls API route

// Service calls API route (client-safe)
export const sendEmail = async (emailData) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/send-email', { /* ... */ });
  // ...
};

// API route handles SendGrid (server-side only)
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  sgMail.setApiKey(SENDGRID_API_KEY); // ✅ Server-side only
  await sgMail.send(msg);
}
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Created API Route (`src/app/api/send-email/route.ts`)
- Handles SendGrid initialization (server-side only)
- Sends emails via SendGrid API
- Returns success/error responses

### 2. Updated Email Service (`src/services/email.ts`)
- Removed direct SendGrid import (no more `fs` error)
- Now calls `/api/send-email` endpoint
- Fallback to console logging if API fails
- Works in both client and server contexts

### 3. Architecture Pattern

```
Client Components
  ↓ (calls)
/services/email.ts (client-safe)
  ↓ (fetch)
/api/send-email (server-side)
  ↓ (uses)
SendGrid SDK (Node.js only)
```

## Benefits

✅ **No More Build Errors** - `fs` module only used server-side  
✅ **Client-Safe** - Can be imported in any component  
✅ **Works Everywhere** - Client, server, API routes  
✅ **Better Security** - SendGrid only on server  
✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful fallbacks

## File Structure

```
src/
├── services/
│   ├── email.ts                    ✅ Updated - client-safe
│   ├── email-templates.ts          ✅ No changes
│   └── pool-invitations.ts         ✅ Uses updated email service
├── app/
│   └── api/
│       ├── send-email/
│       │   └── route.ts            ✅ New - server-side SendGrid
│       └── pools/
│           └── invite/
│               └── route.ts        ✅ No changes
```

## Testing

The error is now fixed! Your app should build successfully.

To test email sending:
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Create a Money Pool and invite someone
3. Check logs for "Email sent successfully"

## Summary

- ✅ Build error fixed
- ✅ Email service now works client-side
- ✅ SendGrid only used server-side
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing code
- ✅ Better architecture and separation of concerns
