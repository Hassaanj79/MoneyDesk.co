## How It Works

### **User Flow:**

1. **Enable 2FA:**
   - User goes to Settings → Security tab
   - Clicks "Enable 2FA"
   - System enables 2FA and sends test code
   - User receives beautiful email with verification code

2. **Login with 2FA:**
   - User logs in normally
   - If 2FA is enabled, they're redirected to verification screen
   - User enters 6-digit code from email
   - Upon success, they're redirected to dashboard

3. **Session Management:**
   - Once verified, user stays logged in for the session
   - No need to re-verify until next login
   - Clean logout clears verification status
